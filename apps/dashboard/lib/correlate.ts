// Log ↔ corpus pairing: which recorded turn produced each log event.
//
// This is the fragile part of replay mode, and the plan's §6 names it the top risk. The
// algorithm is Kevin's, transcribed from `_dashboard_template.html:312-325`: walk the log in
// order, and for each `phase.start` carrying a non-orchestrator role, take that role's next
// unconsumed `invoke-role` turn WITH THE SAME STORY. A per-(role, story) cursor — falling back
// to plain role order for a story-less event or a role whose turns carry no story stamp.
//
// The story scope is load-bearing: a phantom `phase.start` (a role turn that started but recorded
// NO `invoke-role` turn — a died/retried turn) would, under a role-ONLY cursor, slide every later
// pairing for that role by one across story boundaries — wrong transcript, wrong code, no error.
// Scoping the cursor to the story confines that off-by-one to the ONE story that actually had the
// phantom (its last `phase.start` reads unpaired, which the report surfaces) instead of cascading
// into every later story. It still CANNOT detect a genuine log/corpus mismatch, so this module's
// real job remains the REPORT. That is the same failure class as the
// `REPLAY CORPUS MISS` on `dba S1-record-stock` (corpus captured v0.3.0-beta.14 against a
// v0.3.5 pipeline). So this module's real job is not the pairing — it is the REPORT.
//
// `correlate()` therefore returns a `CorrelationReport` the UI can surface, and callers are
// expected to show drift rather than silently render a mis-paired turn.
//
// One structural subtlety, measured rather than assumed (see `STRUCTURAL_ROLES`): a healthy
// corpus has legitimately unpaired events, so "unpaired > 0" is NOT a drift signal on its own.
